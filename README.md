Physical Math - Utilties for calculation with measurments
=========================================================
physmath is a Python module for working with measurments; specifically
wtih regard to their limited accuracy (significant figures) and
their units. The components were originally developed for several
online chemistry apps and it is our hope that you will find them useful
in your own projects.

Currently, parts of this project depends on utilities in the
[hlab](https://github.com/matthagy/hlab) package
and the runtime portion of the
[jamenson](https://github.com/matthagy/jamenson) package.
These dependencies will hopefully be removed in the future.
